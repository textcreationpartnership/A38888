            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>An EXACT and TRUE ACCOUNT Of the Blowing up of the French Magazine OF DUNKIRK; And the particulars of the taking of <hi>Five French Flutes,</hi> Laden with AMMUNITION, By the DUTCH, Sailing from the ſaid Port For <hi>BREST,</hi> deſign'd for <hi>IRELAND.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE <hi>French</hi> Letters ſay, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Letters confirm, that on the <hi>12th</hi> Inſtant, there hapned a terrible and ſurprizing Diſaſter in the <hi>French</hi> Gariſon of <hi>Dunkirk;</hi> for the ſame being look'd upon the Metropolitan over all the <hi>French</hi> Gariſons in the New Conqueſt in <hi>Flanders,</hi> whereby mighty Stores of all Sorts of Munitions of War were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited, for the carrying on the grand Deſigns of <hi>Louis</hi> XIV. was by one Fatal Blow and Diſaſter, thro' the Negligence of a Drunken Workman, or Soldier, with a lighted Pipe of Tobacco, entirely Blown up and Deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>The Certainty of the Occaſion cannot be authentickly known, becauſe the Powder gave no minutes for Enquiry, but precipitately carried all before it into the Region of the Air, which as it was more Incluſive, had greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive Efficacy on the Gariſon, it having deſtroyed and wholly ruined one Third of the Interiour Fortifications, with one Baſtion, and made a large Breach in the Wall of the Side towards the Sea, there being computed 2000 Barrels of Powder to be loſt, which is an extreme Injury to <hi>France,</hi> the ſame being valued at 8 <hi>l</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> each Barrel beſides the Store of Arms and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition adjoining, are either broke to pieces, or burned in the Ruines, there not being one part of the ſaid Gariſon but what received its dreadful Effects either by the deſtruction of the Houſes, or killing ſome People therein, the tops of all the Buildings being either carried away, or broke down afterwards
<pb facs="tcp:98930:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>with the Stones, or other ponderous weight which fell thereon. And the Damage is almoſt Irreparable, One hundred thouſand Pounds being not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to put it into its priſtine Condition, for the terrible Shock which it made, has created a great many Cracks, and diſmal Caſma's in the very Wall of the Fortifications, which muſt be wholly taken down to the ground to be repaired, otherwiſe Untenable; and, upon a ſtrict Examination, about 530 People, as well Soldiers as Inhabitants, have periſhed in this <hi>Cataſtrophe,</hi> among them 43 Officers, and above 300 others are miſerably ſhatter'd or wounded with the Stones: And there are ſome which conclude that it was occaſioned by the Treachery of ſeveral new Convert Soldiers, but conſidering that the perſon which perpretated it, was a Companion in the miſery which enſued, we believe that it was more Misfortune than Deſign; and the rather, for that it was known, that a conſiderable Quantity of Powder brought from Foreign Parts, had, by the Saline and Vaporous Quality of the Sea received ſome Detriment, whereby it was drying, and making again ſerviceable. However it was (as all Advantages with Enemies are beſt) it betokens a lucky pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of Affairs to all the Confederates in the enſuing Campagne, eſpecially in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to which place the ſaid Powder was principally deſign'd, and where we do not doubt the <hi>French</hi> Rhodomantado's as ſoon as appear, will vaniſh in Smoke.</p>
            <p>And this direful Misfortune (as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proverb denotes, <hi>Comes ſeldom Alone</hi>) is uſhered in with another; which tho' it may not be attended with thoſe dreadful Circumſtances of the loſs of much People, yet it carries with it, and beſpeak as fatal a Conſequence to the <hi>French</hi> King's Affairs; for as he was lately come to the Zenith of his Glory, it will be a means to bring him to the declenſion of his Uſurpation and Tyranny, which the ſage <hi>Prognoſticks</hi> conclude it near accompliſhed, as is the good Tydings which we have verify'd and confirm'd by the laſt <hi>Dutch</hi> Poſt: That Five <hi>French</hi> Flutes laden in the Port of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> with all Sorts of Munitions of War, and going under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy of two of their Privateers for <hi>Breſt,</hi> deſign'd for <hi>Ireland,</hi> were intercepted and taken by three <hi>Dutch</hi> Men of War; their Convoys, after receiving the firſt Broadſide, ſheering off, eſcaped; and they are now actually brought into <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> where being examined into, are found to be Freighted with theſe following Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In one of them are 16 Demi-Culverins upon Carriages, with Sponges, Ladles, and all other Materials thereto, as Traces, and Harneſs for the Draught Horſes. 236 Barrels of Gunpowder. 6000 Iron Bullets. 120 Quintals of Match. 500 Barrels of Muſquet, Carbine, and Piſtol ſhot. 1500 Chevaux de Frize. 400 Tuneſpiks. 800 Gabions, and other Baskets. 7000 Mattocks, as many Shovels. 300 Wheel-Barrows. 2 Mortars. 600 Bombs, from 60 to 100 <hi>l.</hi> weight each. 6000 Horſe-ſhoes. 2000 Saddles, as many Bridles, with Holſters for Piſtols, and Cruppers. 4000 New Tents. 3000 Firelock Muſquets. 2000 Matchlocks. 1000 Fuſees. 6000 Swords, Bandaliers, Belts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with much other materials, too long to incert, all which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as Prize, and are to be brought to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and the greateſt part order'd to <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> and <hi>Breda</hi> for the uſe of the States Army.</p>
